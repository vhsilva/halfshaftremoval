Half Shaft Removal Tool

In Drive Unit remanufacturing, we'd often get back units that have one of the half shafts stuck in the drive unit. Without a proper tool, 
it would take technicians at least 20 min to pry it out. The line supervisors requested a tool that would allow the technicians to push
the stuck half shaft out from the other side. 

This tool would enter from one side of the drive unit and push the from inside the differential since that's where the half shaft would get
jammed. The tool's "teeth" are long and hard enough to push the half shaft out of a differtial's splines.
